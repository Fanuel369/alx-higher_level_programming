Tests for a function a name
===============================
example, if both names are provided, print both,
if one is given print it.
================================
The library has only one function called say_my_name

    >>> say_my_name = __import__("3-say_my_name").say_my_name
    >>> say_my_name("Erick", "Kiminza")
    My name is Erick Kiminza

    works also if one name is passed
    
    >>> say_my_name("Erick") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    My name is Erick

    >>> say_my_name("", "Erick") # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    My name is Erick

    Raises an exception if name is not a string
    >>> say_my_name(12, "Kilo") # doctest: +SKIP
    first_name must be a string
